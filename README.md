## Product Name
Timer Web App

## Product Description
The Timer Web App is a web-based application designed to provide a timer functionality with a unique set of features. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and follows Google's Material Design principles for a modern and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
1. **Timer Functionality**: The application features a timer that starts a default countdown of 3 hours once the user clicks the start button.
2. **Start and Stop Buttons**: The start button is centered on the screen by default. Once the timer starts, the start button is replaced by a stop button, allowing the user to stop the timer.
3. **Alarm**: An alarm sound plays for 10 seconds once the 3-hour timer completes. The alarm loops continuously during this period.
4. **App Disabling**: After the alarm stops, the application becomes disabled for the next 10 minutes. The start button is greyed out during this period.
5. **Manual Restart**: Once the 10-minute disable period is over, the start button reappears, but the timer does not start automatically. The user must press the start button again to restart the timer.
6. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both mobile and computer browsers.
7. **Inactive Browser Support**: The timer continues to function even if the browser screen is not active.
8. **Navigation Bar**: The application features a navigation bar with a clock icon and a hamburger menu. The menu includes a FAQ tab that links to a separate FAQ page.
9. **FAQ Page**: An interactive FAQ page with an accordion component for a better user experience.
10. **Footer**: The footer section is always sticky to the bottom of the page and displays the text “Made with love in India” with a heart icon that changes color on hover.
11. **Button Animation**: Once the timer starts, an animation begins on the button, visually representing the countdown. The animation stops once the timer starts.
12. **Dynamic Timer Text**: The timer text dynamically updates to display the remaining time. Once the 3-hour timer completes and the 10-minute disable period starts, the timer text updates to display the remaining disable time.
13. **Material Design**: The application follows Google's Material Design principles for a sleek and modern look.
